# 19CS301-Module-6
EX: 6.1   POLYMORPHISM

### AIM: To Create two specific classes- Beans and Mango. Along with that, create a generic function that tells us the type and color of the object we pass. Mind you, since we have passed only “obj” through it, this obj can be any object.


### ALGORITHM:
Step1: create class Beans and def a function type and color

Step 2: create a class Mango and def a function type and color

Step3: def a function func

Step 4: call the objects and execute the program

### PROGRAM:
```
#Name:Rizwan T
#Reg no:212222090008

class Beans ():
    def type(self):   
          print("Vegetable")
    def color(self):
          print("Green")
class Mango:
   def type(self):
          print("Fruit")
   def color(self):
         print("Yellow")
   def func(obj):
         obj.type()
         obj.color()
         obj_beans = Beans()
         obj_mango = Mango()
         func(obj_beans)
         func(obj_mango)
```

### RESULT: Thus, the program has been successfully executed.

EXP.No: 6.b OPERATOR OVERLOADING

### AIM: write a python program to overload less than operator
###ALGORITHM:
Step1 :create class A and def init	 

Step2: def it	with a condition if self.a < o.a 

Step 3: call the function and execute the program.
### PROGRAM:
```
#Name:Rizwan T
#Reg no:212222040134

class A :
     def     init (self,a):
             self.a=a
     def     lt (self,o):
              if self.a < o.a :
                   return "ob1 is less than ob2"
              else:
                   return "ob2 is less than ob1"
ob1 = A(2)
ob2 = A(3)
print(ob1<ob2)
```

###RESULT: Thus, the program has been successfully executed.
EX: 6.3 ABSTRACT CLASS METHOD

### AIM: To Create the abstract method calculate_area which is of the abstract class 'Shape'

### ALGORITHM:
Step1:Get input from the user

Step2:put class function to define the function using self

Step3:By using the function to find the area of the rectangle and circle Step4:Execute the program.

### PROGRAM:
```
#Name:Rizwan T
#Reg no:212222040134

from abc import ABC
class Shape(ABC):
            def calculate_area(self):
                Pass
class Rectangle(Shape):
               length = 5
               breadth =3
               def calculate_area(self):
                   print("Area of a rectangle:",self.length * self.breadth)
class Circle(Shape):
             radius = 4
             def calculate_area(self):
                     print("Area of a circle:",3.14 * self.radius * self.radius)
a=Rectangle()
b=Circle()
a.calculate_area()
b.calculate_area()
```

### RESULT: Thus, the program has been successfully executed.

EXP.No: 6.4     ENCAPSULATION
### AIM: To Implement Encapsulation using private members –of a class rectangle with private variables length,width.
###ALGORITHM: Step1: put class function to define the function using self Step2: By using the function to find the area of the rectangle Step3: Execute the program.
###PROGRAM:
```
#Name:Rizwan T
#Reg no:212222040134

class Rectangle:
 	length = 0
 	breadth = 0
  def	init	(self):
       self.	length = 5
       self.	breadth = 3
  print(self.	length)
  print(self.	breadth)
rect = Rectangle()
```
